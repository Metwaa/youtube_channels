# Setup project
Create new project in <a href = "https://console.cloud.google.com/"> Google Cloud Console </a>

# Setup VM
Create instance with the following specifications:

- region: closest to you with low co2
- Machine Type: e2-standard-4 (4 vCPU, 16 GB Memory)
- Change boot disk: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Size: 30 GB (my Recommendation that size not less than60GB)
- you might have to enable the compute engine API if you haven't created a VM on this account before

# Setup SSH to VM
- in your local terminal:

      ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/<DESIREDNAMEOFYOURKEY> -C <DESIREDUSERNAMEONVM> -b 2048

- cat out the public key:

      cat .ssh/<DESIREDNAMEOFYOURKEY>.pub
- copy output, go to VM instance on Google Cloud Console & paste ssh key under Metadata
- Go back to the VM and start it, copy the external IP
- Create a config-file locally under your .ssh directory with the following content:
  
      Host <hostname to use when connecting>
      HostName <external IP>
      User <DESIREDUSERNAMEONVM you specified in ssh-keygen command>
      IdentityFile <path to your private key> e.g.  ~/.ssh/privatekey
  
- go to your local terminal and type
  
      ssh <hostname to use when connecting>
Congrats! You're now connected to your VM ü§©
